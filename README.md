# deviget-code-test
Code challenge for the Mid-level Javascript Developer #MM opening

I've managed to get all functionalities recognisable at the demo video in the following order: <br>
Started with data model for redux store, just after that resolve the fetching of posts from reddit, just to have data to work with.<br>
Then I rendered the posts lists, and started adding styles and dismiss functionality.<br>
Then added the dismiss-all-posts functionality.<br>
Render the active post.<br>
Filter the dismissed from posts to render.<br>
Add the "read" state for listed posts.<br>
At last I've added the swipe handler for the navigation column.

Tried to add tests, but I'm not familiarized with front-end tests, I've worked with backend function tests with Jest. I can see that in Front-end there is a diferent aproche to this. I'm really interested in start working with Front-end tests in the near future but didn't feel sure to learn and incorporate them on the run.
